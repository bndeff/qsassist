Assistant Quick Settings Tile
=============================

## Launch your default assist app from the notification shade

This app provides an alternative way to launch the assistant on devices with no home button to long-press.

It has no launcher icon, you have to add it to your Quick Settings tiles. Look for the pencil icon in the notification shade. You also need to set a default assist app in your device settings.
